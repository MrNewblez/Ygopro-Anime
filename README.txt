Repository for the report of Custom or Nerfed Anime Cards.

What to do if you know how to script and would like to send in a fix(You will need a GitHub account):
1. Find the card ID in your YgoPro.
2. Find and click the corresponding card script in the script folder in the GitHub.
3. Click the edit button (it looks like a pen/pencil next to the trashcan)
4. Copy your fixed code over the code in the window given.
5. In the box that says "Add and optional extended description" put in what the change you made is and give evidence about it such as the episode that shows monster effect,
if the card should not exist just state it should not exist or the effect is never shown.
6. Press Propose File Change.
7. Press Create Pull request.

If you do not have knowledge of scripting, but would still like to help,
you can follow the same the same instructions above but instead of putting new code in just at the bottom of the code make a new line and put ~~~~.
Then you can follow the rest of the instructions.
